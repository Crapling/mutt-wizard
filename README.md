# mutt-wizard
This is a fork of Luke Smith's mutt-wizard found here: https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard.
I just made minor tweaks to make it fit for my likings.

## changes
- changed some colors and keybinds
- set urlscan as a keybinding
- set abook folder location according to XDG Base Directory Specification
### This version requires urlscan!
